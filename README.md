The project is an implementation of OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries. OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that provides a wide range of functions for image and video processing. MediaPipe is a cross-platform, high-fidelity body pose tracking solution framework, that is used for building multi-modal applied machine learning pipelines. The project utilises MediaPipe to obtain the 33 major landmark coordinates of the human body. MediaPipe utilizes BlazePose[1] topology, a superset of COCO[2], BlazeFace[3], and BlazePalm[4] topology. These landmark coordinates form the basis for the pose estimation. The appropriate angles formed by landmarks while performing the asana precisely are compared to the personâ€™s live feed of performingthe asana. The project then provides voice feedback so that the person can make alterations to the pose and avoid misalignment of the body so that the yoga asana can be performed efficiently without developing aches while attaining the numerous benefits of practising yoga.
